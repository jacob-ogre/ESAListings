# ESAListings

A small R package and associated R Shiny app for displaying ESA listing information.

## Source

This repo is a not-quite-fork of [the repo by @mjevans26](https://github.com/mjevans26/esasummary).
R package update broke several things, include the app that is a part of this
package, during a server transition. @mjevans26's repo was set up as an R project
not conducive to `devtools::install_github`, so we just set up a new repo.
